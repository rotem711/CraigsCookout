        # 2. I then printed out '@current_user' and "@current_user.cookouts"

    # This is a bug with Rails as per this Rails issue that was already acknowledged by their team, but will never be fixed:
    # https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/32376

    # What this means: 'destroy' literally has no way of adding validations, Rails will do it no matter what when it is called
    # even in scenarios where two models are dependent on each other, see this reply:
    # https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/32376#issuecomment-787461818

    # However, I can still add an 'else' section to provide a 'status' 400 in this scenario
