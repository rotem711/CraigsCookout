Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # CRUD: CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE
  # RAILS VERSION OF CRUD --> SHUD: SHOW INDEX UPDATE DELETE
  
  # Optionally, we can limit the CRUD methods we allow:
  # resources :cookouts, only: [:index, :create]

  # NOTE: By just using 'resources :cookouts' we can then allow for ALL CRUD methods so that I can also allow a 'show' route

  # PREVIOUS ROUTE DECLARATION VIA 'resources' MACRO:
  # resources :cookouts

  # NOTE: This is what is provided by the 'resources' macro from Rails:
  # This is the ':index' route provided by the 'resources' macro:
  # get "/cookouts", to: "cookouts#index"
  # This is the ':create' route provided by the 'resources' macro:
  # post "/cookouts", to: "cookouts#create"

  # WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE FRONTEND:
  # To create cookouts: On the frontend, I need to make a frontend 'post' request for '/cookouts'
  # To get cookouts: On the frontend, I need to make a frontend 'get' request for '/cookouts':

  # What I had previously before I decided everything should be CRUD compatible:
  # resources :foods, only: [:index, :create]

  # PREVIOUS ROUTE DECLARATION VIA 'resources' MACRO:
  # resources :foods

  # NOTE: This was modified to include 'nested routing' so I can access specific cookouts with specific foods:
  resources :cookouts do 
    resources :foods
  end

  # Login related routes:
  post "/signup", to: "users#create"
  get "/me", to: "users#show"
  post "/login", to: "sessions#create"
  delete "/logout", to: "sessions#destroy"
  get "*path", to: "fallback#index", constraints: ->(req) { !req.xhr? && req.format.html? }

end
